The current system application is a part of my 3rd year course, 2nd sem requirement for Software Engineer 1 subject.
This is a standalone-app built upon the PERN(Postgres, Express.js, React.js, Node.js),
hosted on local host(PC) to simulate a desktop application capability.
The main functionality is CRUD Operations of records with simple data 
analysis, utilized to provide solution for university guidance monitoring.
